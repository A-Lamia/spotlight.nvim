This is a proof of concept addon for dimming and highlighting in a way that is biased
towards my own personal taste, I like the dimming effect that highlights what window
you should be focusing on but i dislike neovim default implementation and the lack
active floating window highlights.


This is in a working state currently but is still a proof of concept and is subject
to heavy breaking modifications and abandonment if the concept seems to hacky or difficault
to maintain.
